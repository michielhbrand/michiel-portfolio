    content: "As a teenager, I had my hopes set on a career in the aviation industry. After obtaining my PPL as a high-schooler, I enrolled for a Bachelors degree program as insurance. The engineering program won me over and I realised that a career in aviation was not for me. <br><br>

    Whilst a student, I found the gap to upgrade my PPL to a CPL and continue to fly as a hobbiest. I am forever grateful for the crucial role that pilot training played in my maturation and intellectual development. Through flying, I have acquired a keen eye for detail, developed an inquisitive curiosity and problem solving skills. I have also learned the meaning of professional responsibility and troubleshooting in high pressure environments. These qualities still shape my professional life as an engineer. <br><br>
    
    Though I am nowhere near a real prop-head, I have loved everything that aviation has tought me along with the beautiful places it has taken me. There is nothing quite like the diverse South African landscapes from 2000 feet. From the Midlands to the Winelands and the Lowveld to the Kalahari."

    content: "I have been gripped with guitar playing for well over a decade. Guitar playing has been that hobby that is kept ablaze by the fairytale thought that I _can_ become as good as John Mayer if only I keep trying. Learning to play the guitar has tought me discipline perhaps more than anything else. The smallest of movements separate beautiful from horrific. There is no way to hide a sloppy technique or an imperfect note. <br><br>
    
    The most satisfying kind of playing, though, has been playing with a band of musicians. The times when I played with musicians of various skill levels truely tested my collaborative skills and teamwork. It has, no doubt, been one of the most difficult things I have ever done, and one of the most rewarding things too. Making music stretches the creative (and lazy) side of my brain where nothing happens quickly or smoothly. It is, however, a most satisfying way to relax and to express creativity."

    image: "/images/run-mtb-join-1.png"
    content: "Physical exercise is a drug and I love it. I am not ashamed to admit that I have poured hundreds of hours into physical exercise, particularly running and mountain biking. This wasn't always the case, however. In my early twenties, exercise was no more than a social activity. Over time, the experience of physical improvements turned into a mild obsession. My _problem_ is that in being competitive with myself, I want to push my physical limits to experience performance related improvements. There is something increadibly satisfying about enduring periods of pain and discomfort that yield lasting results. 
    <br><br>
    I place a share of the blame for this love on the stellar mountains and sunny weather of [Stellenbosch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zYwv93r8pyQpGBYh6). I don't expect many places in the world to be able to match the prestine scenes of this town."
