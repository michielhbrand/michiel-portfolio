    content: "When I was 17 years old, I was given the chance to complete the PPL program. Only a few years later, however, while studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering, I realised that a career in aviation was far less glamorous than it initally appeared to be. <br><br>
    After completing my undergraduate engineering degree, I was able to upgrade my PPL to CPL and continue to fly as a hobbiest. Though I am nowhere near a real prop-head, I have loved everything that aviation has tought me along with the beautiful places it has taken me. Through flying, I have acquired a keen eye for detail and learned to manage responsibilities in a high pressure environment."

    content: "I have been gripped by guitar playing for over a decade. It has been that hobby kept ablaze by the fairytale thought that I can become as good as John Meyer if only I kept trying. Learning to play the guitar has tought me discipline perhaps more than anything else. The smallest of movements separate beautiful from horrific. Learning to play with other musicians was painstakingly difficult at first, but it yealded a most satisfying feeling. Making music stretches the (lazy) right side of my brain where nothing happens quickly or smoothly. It is, however, a brilliant way to relax. "

    image: "/images/run-mtb-join-1.png"
    content: "Physical exercise is a drug and I love it. I am not ashamed to admit that I have poured hundreds of hours into physical exercise, particularly running and mountain biking. My _problem_ is that I am very competitive with myself. I love pushing my physical limits and experiencing performance related improvements. There is something increadibly satisfying about enduring periods of pain and discomfort that yield lasting results. 
    <br><br>
    I have to put a share of the blame on the stellar mountains and warm weather of Stellenbosch. I don't expect many places in the world to be able to match the prestine scenes of this town."
