Welcome to my portfolio site. Here, you will find useful information about me - my life and profession. I currently reside in Stellenbosch, South Africa, the heart of the Cape Winelands. During office hours, I am a Software Engineer for a subsidiary of the [Alphawave Group](https://alphawave.co.za/). Outside office hours you may find me with my wife in the nearby mountains, in the air or sharpening my trade.
