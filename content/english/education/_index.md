**Abstract**

Accurate techniques of extracting dielectric properties for the purpose of material characterisation is an important application field in material science. This project examines a resonant approach to extracting dielectric properties of materials. Two microstrip resonator designs are compared with the aim to establish inkjet printed circuits as an accurate and inexpensive method of circuit building.

**Abstract**

Tuberculosis continues to pose a threat to many groups of under resourced communities, especially in Africa and Asia. Accurate diagnostics and early treatment has proved to be a constant challenge in many of these regions. Recent years have seen many developments in diagnostic tools at the point of care. In addition, smartphones have shown increased popularity in the development of point of care devices.

It was the aim of this project to design a smartphone based optical biosensor. The design would utilise the smartphone camera for image acquisition and processing power for image analysis. The final methodology makes use of a microbead aggregation technique
to identify IFNÎ³ in serum. This is accomplished by observing the passing of a microbead solution through a microfluidic channel. Protein identification is accomplished by distinguishing aggregated microbeads from single, unbound microbeads.

The microbead aggregation technique was verified at a component level. A microfluidic channel was design and tested to efficiently mix and streamline fluids. Image capturing at small scale was successfully demonstrated using a smartphone. Video analysis is demon-
strated through a custom built mobile App with functionalities for video processing by object identification and tracking. The project was successful in proving the methodological concepts and partially successful in meeting the original goals and desired outcomes.
